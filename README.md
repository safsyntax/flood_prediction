# flood_prediction

🌧️ Flood Prediction using Machine Learning
This project aims to build a predictive model for estimating flood probability using historical data and machine learning techniques. Developed in Python, the model leverages linear regression and feature selection to forecast flooding based on various environmental indicators.

📌 Project Overview
Flooding can have devastating consequences on communities and infrastructure. Accurate prediction of flood risks enables better preparedness and response strategies. In this project, I built a supervised regression model to estimate flood probabilities based on 20 initial features. The approach involves feature selection, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization of results.

🔧 Tools & Technologies
Language: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

Model: Linear Regression

Validation: 70:30 train-test split with 5-fold cross-validation

Metrics: R² (R-squared), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Visual Forecasts

🧠 Key Steps
Data Preparation

Loaded and cleaned data using pandas.

Identified relevant features for flood prediction.

Feature Selection

Used Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to isolate and remove the 10 least impactful predictors, improving model performance and interpretability.

Model Development

Trained a Linear Regression model on the remaining features.

Applied a 70:30 train-test split and validated performance with 5-fold cross-validation to ensure model generalizability.

Performance Evaluation

Evaluated the model using:

R-squared (R²) to measure how well the model explains variance.

Mean Squared Error (MSE) to quantify prediction accuracy.

Visualizations (e.g., actual vs. predicted plots) to assess performance and trends visually.

📈 Results & Insights
The model demonstrated moderate predictive capabilities, with performance metrics indicating a reasonable fit. The feature selection process helped simplify the model while retaining the most informative variables. Forecast visualizations provided intuitive insights into how well the model performs across the test dataset.
